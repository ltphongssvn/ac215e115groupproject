# Agentic Graph RAG Orchestrator

Production-ready hybrid retrieval system combining **vector search**, **graph traversal**, and **agentic reasoning** to overcome the limitations of traditional RAG systems.

## Overview

Agentic Graph RAG represents the next evolution of generative AI, addressing critical architectural bottlenecks in conventional systems:

- **Corporate Knowledge Fragmentation** - Traditional systems partition knowledge; Graph RAG models relationships as first-class elements
- **Temporal Discontinuity** - Vector systems lack temporal awareness; Graph Memory implements bi-temporal tracking (T, T')
- **Reasoning Deficiencies** - Vector similarity fails at multi-hop reasoning; Graph traversal enables complex relationship paths
- **Tool Coordination Gap** - Static systems can't orchestrate tools; Agentic capabilities enable strategic tool utilization

## Architecture: 8-Pillar Agentic Framework

### 1. Knowledge Representation
Transforms information into connected graph structures (Neo4j) with weighted edges for confidence scoring and relationship strength. Supports multiple representations: Property Graphs (flexibility), RDF (reasoning), Hypergraphs (n-ary relationships).

### 2. Memory Systems
4-layer graph-based memory addressing "relationship amnesia":
- **Episodic Memory** - Raw events with full context
- **Semantic Memory** - Extracted facts and entities (consolidation threshold: 10 events)
- **Procedural Memory** - Workflow sequences (action chains)
- **Temporal Memory** - Bi-temporal tracking (event_time T, ingestion_time T')

### 3. Hybrid Retrieval Pipeline
**3-Stage Sequential Process:**
1. **Vector Search** - Semantic similarity for initial candidate nodes
2. **Graph Traversal** - Multi-hop reasoning (max_depth=2, min_weight=0.5)
3. **Context Synthesis** - Combines vector + graph results with relevance scoring

### 4. Agentic Reasoning
Autonomous decision-making through:
- **Temporal Query Detection** - Automatically classifies queries (temporal vs standard)
- **Contextual Understanding** - Relationship-based adaptation
- **Memory Persistence** - Builds upon accumulated knowledge
- **Strategic Tool Utilization** - Procedural workflow orchestration

### 5. Bi-Temporal Tracking
Tracks both event time (when it happened) and ingestion time (when system learned it), enabling point-in-time queries: "What was true last month?"

### 6. Self-Evolution
**Data Flywheel:** Usage patterns → Insights → Enhanced knowledge structures
- Tracks query types and confidence scores
- Episodic buffer consolidation (threshold: 10 events)
- Creates competitive moat through accumulated contextual understanding

### 7. Multi-hop Reasoning
Weighted graph traversal with configurable depth:
```python
path_weight = reduce(w * rel.weight for rel in path)
# Filters paths by min_weight threshold
```

### 8. Context Synthesis
Relevance scoring across vector and graph sources with deduplication and score normalization.

## Quick Start

### Build & Run
```bash
cd services/rag-orchestrator
docker build -t rag-orchestrator:agentic .
docker run -p 8002:8002 rag-orchestrator:agentic
```

### API Usage Examples

**Standard Query (Vector + Graph):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/rag/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are rice prices?", "max_results": 5}'

# Response:
# {
#   "query_type": "standard",
#   "confidence": 0.90,
#   "metadata": {"reasoning": "vector + graph hybrid"}
# }
```

**Temporal Query (Automatic Detection):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/rag/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What was the rice price last month?"}'

# Response:
# {
#   "query_type": "temporal",
#   "confidence": 0.85,
#   "metadata": {
#     "event_time": "2025-10-12T02:11:45.128276",
#     "reasoning": "multi-hop temporal traversal"
#   }
# }
```

**Store Procedural Workflow:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/rag/workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workflow_id": "rice_analysis",
    "steps": [
      {"action": "fetch_data", "params": {"source": "db"}},
      {"action": "analyze", "params": {"method": "trend"}}
    ]
  }'
```

**Self-Evolution Metrics:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8002/rag/stats

# Response:
# {
#   "usage_patterns": {
#     "standard": {"count": 1, "avg_confidence": 0.9},
#     "temporal": {"count": 1, "avg_confidence": 0.85}
#   },
#   "episodic_buffer_size": 2
# }
```
