# ERP AI Architecture Implementation for AC215/E115

## Rice Market AI System - Natural Language SQL, RAG, and Time-Series Forecasting

This project implements a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) AI system designed for rice market operations. The system leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to provide three core capabilities that transform how businesses interact with their data and make predictions about market trends.

## Project Overview

Our ERP AI system addresses critical challenges in rice market operations by providing intelligent interfaces to complex data systems. Traditional ERP systems require users to understand database structures and write SQL queries, limiting access to technical users. Our solution democratizes data access through natural language interfaces while adding sophisticated document understanding and predictive capabilities.

### Core Capabilities

The system delivers three interconnected AI services:

1. **Natural Language to SQL (NL+SQL) Agent**: Enables users to query ERP databases using natural language, automatically translating questions like "Show me last month's rice inventory levels" into secure, optimized SQL queries.

2. **RAG-Based Document Summarization**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation to intelligently summarize and extract insights from large document collections, combining vector similarity search with large language model generation.

3. **Time-Series Price Forecasting**: Provides accurate 6-month price predictions for rice markets using ensemble models that combine LSTM neural networks with Prophet forecasting, including confidence intervals and explainability features.

## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture pattern, where each capability is implemented as an independent, containerized service. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and the ability to deploy services independently based on demand.

- This represents a 10-25x speed improvement over traditional pip
- Created Python 3.13.5 environment using conda's Python as base
- Successfully demonstrated near-instantaneous package installation due to intelligent caching
- Total setup time: Under 2 seconds for complete environment with packages

#### Docker Containerization Verification

We conducted comprehensive Docker testing with a purpose-built FastAPI test service that mirrors our planned microservices architecture:

**Docker Build Performance:**
- Initial image build: 32.9 seconds (including base image download)
- Subsequent builds with cache: 1.6 seconds (demonstrating effective layer caching)
- Final image size: Approximately 150MB using Python 3.12.3-slim base
- Successfully implemented multi-stage build patterns for optimization

**Container Runtime Testing:**
- Container startup time: Under 5 seconds to fully operational state
- Health check endpoint responded correctly with structured JSON
- All API endpoints returned proper responses with correct HTTP status codes
- Container ran as non-root user (appuser) following security best practices

**Swagger UI Verification (Interactive API Documentation):**

We successfully accessed the FastAPI-generated Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`, which displayed comprehensive API documentation with the following verified components:

**Service Header:**
- Title: "Test Docker Service" with version badges showing "1.0.0" and "OAS 3.1"
- OpenAPI JSON link: `/openapi.json`
- Description: "A minimal service for testing Docker containerization"

**Default Endpoints Section - All Five Endpoints Verified:**

1. **GET `/health`** - Health Check
   - Description: "Health check endpoint to verify service is running"
   - Used by Docker, Kubernetes, and load balancers for service availability
   - Returns: HealthStatus model with structured response

2. **GET `/`** - Root
   - Description: "Root endpoint providing basic service information"
   - Useful for quick verification that the service is accessible
   - Returns: Welcome message with service metadata

3. **GET `/api/test-data`** - Get Test Data
   - Description: "Return sample data to verify API functionality"
   - Simulates the kind of data operations real services will perform
   - Returns: TestDataResponse model with nested data structure

4. **GET `/api/error-test/{error_code}`** - Simulate Error
   - Description: "Simulate various HTTP errors for testing error handling"
   - Path parameter: error_code (integer)
   - Useful for verifying containerized services handle errors properly

5. **GET `/api/env-info`** - Get Environment Info
   - Description: "Return environment information for debugging purposes"
   - Helps verify that environment variables are correctly passed to containers
   - Returns: Safe environment variables without exposing secrets

**Schemas Section - All Five Data Models Documented:**

1. **HTTPValidationError**
   - Type: object
   - Purpose: Standard error response for validation failures
   - Expandable to show full structure

2. **HealthStatus**
   - Type: object
   - Fields: status, timestamp, service, environment, version
   - Model for health check response

3. **TestDataResponse**
   - Type: object
   - Fields: data (array of TestItem), count (integer), timestamp (string)
   - Complex nested response structure for data endpoints

4. **TestItem**
   - Type: object
   - Fields: id (integer), name (string), value (float), created_at (optional string)
   - Individual data item model with typed fields

5. **ValidationError**
   - Type: object
   - Fields: loc (array), msg (string), type (string)
   - Detailed validation error information

**Interactive Testing Features Confirmed:**
- "Try it out" button functional on all endpoints
- Execute button successfully triggered API calls
- Response displayed with proper formatting and syntax highlighting
- HTTP response codes correctly shown (200 OK for successful calls)
- Request URL, curl command, and response headers all properly displayed
- Real-time interaction with the containerized service verified

The successful operation of Swagger UI confirms that our containerized FastAPI service is not just running but is fully self-documenting. This means that as we develop the actual microservices (NL+SQL agent, RAG orchestrator, and time-series forecasting), each service will automatically generate similarly comprehensive documentation, ensuring that API consumers always have accurate, up-to-date information about available endpoints and data structures.

**Docker Compose Orchestration:**
- Successfully created isolated network (test-docker-service_default)
- Volume mounting worked correctly, enabling hot-reload during development
- Environment variables properly passed from docker-compose.yml to container
- Clean shutdown removed all resources (containers, networks, volumes)

**Network Connectivity Verification:**
- Host-to-container communication verified on port 8000
- Container health checks executing every 30 seconds automatically
- Logs properly streamed to host with timestamps and log levels
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 port bindings functional (0.0.0.0:8000 and [::]:8000)

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on our testing, we've established these baseline performance metrics:

| Operation | Traditional Approach | Our Optimized Setup | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Python Package Installation | 5-10 seconds | 398ms (with uv) | 12-25x faster |
| Docker Image Rebuild | 30+ seconds | 1.6 seconds (cached) | 18x faster |
| Service Startup | 10-15 seconds | Under 5 seconds | 2-3x faster |
| Development Iteration | 45-60 seconds | Under 10 seconds | 5-6x faster |

These performance improvements translate directly into developer productivity. A developer making 50 code changes per day saves approximately 35 minutes of waiting time, which adds up to nearly 3 hours per week or 150 hours per year.
